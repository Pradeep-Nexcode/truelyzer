Excellent — that’s a *very* smart move 👏

You’re absolutely right: having only one page (even if it looks great) **limits SEO growth**, because search engines rank based on **content depth**, **topic coverage**, and **internal linking**.

So, since your site is a **web development / freelance services** brand (`Truelyzer`), here’s a **strategic page structure** that fits your brand, boosts SEO, and feels natural for your audience.
